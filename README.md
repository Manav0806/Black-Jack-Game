# Introduction
This Python script implements a basic Blackjack game with a set of house rules. The game allows players to draw cards and compete against a computer opponent.

# House Rules
The deck is unlimited in size.
There are no jokers.
The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
The Ace can count as 11 or 1.
Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.

# How to Play
Players start with two cards each.
The goal is to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
A hand with an Ace and a 10-value card is a Blackjack and has a special score of 0.
Players can choose to draw additional cards ("hit") or pass ("stand").
The game ends when a player decides to pass, exceeds 21, or both players have completed their turns.
